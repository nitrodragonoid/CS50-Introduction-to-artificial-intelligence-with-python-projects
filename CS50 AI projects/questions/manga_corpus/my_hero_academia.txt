Among the Quirk-enhanced individuals, a few of them earn the title of Heroes, who cooperate with the authorities in rescue operations and aprehending criminals who abuse their powers, commonly known as Villains.

Production
Development
Horikoshi stated that after his previous series Barrage was cancelled after just two volumes, he was sad and out of ideas.[4] In order to get more ideas, he revisited a one-shot he previously published in Akamaru Jump, titled My Hero (僕のヒーロー, Boku no Hīrō). This would end up being the basis for the series.[5] Horikoshi was also a big fan of American films and comics, like Spider-Man directed by Sam Raimi, Star Wars, and X-Men, which he used for inspiration.[6][5] Horikoshi cites Masashi Kishimoto's Naruto as being the main influence for his art, specifically stating it gave him a love for drawing hands.[7] Horikoshi has also cited Dragon Ball, Ultraman, and Kamen Rider as sources of inspiration.[6][5]

Themes and analysis
Horikoshi has stated that the main theme he focuses on is "what makes a hero."[8] Horikoshi has also stated that he likes stories with bad endings, as well as horror stories. However, he finds these difficult to draw since his mood when he draws is the same in the story. In order to combat this, he puts in more silly-looking characters like Fat Gum, in order to keep the mood up.[8]
