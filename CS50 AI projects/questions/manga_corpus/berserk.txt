Berserk (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone mercenary, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk". Miura premiered a prototype of Berserk in 1988. The series began the following year in the Hakusensha's now-defunct magazine Monthly Animal House, which was replaced in 1992 by the semimonthly magazine Young Animal, where Berserk continues to be published intermittently. Miura died of aortic dissection in May 2021, leaving it unclear whether the manga will continue to be serialized.

Berserk was adapted into a 25-episode anime television series by Oriental Light and Magic, which covered the Golden Age story arc, and was broadcast from October 1997 to March 1998. The Golden Age arc was also adapted into a trilogy of theatrical anime films; the first two films premiered in 2012 and the third film premiered in 2013. A second 24-episode anime television adaptation was broadcast for two seasons in 2016 and 2017.

As of May 2021, the Berserk manga had over 50 million copies in circulation, including digital versions, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. It received the Award for Excellence at the 6th installment of the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2002. Berserk has been widely acclaimed, particularly for its dark setting, storytelling, characters, and Miura's detailed artwork.


Plot guts is a lone warrior who was born from a hanged corpse and raised as a mercenary by Gambino, his adoptive father, who tried to murder him and was killed by Guts in self defense. Guts earns a fearsome reputation as a fighter, catching the attention of Griffith, the charismatic leader of the Band of the Hawk, a mercenary group. Griffith forces Guts to join the group after defeating him in battle. Guts quickly rises through the ranks of the band, eventually becoming Griffith's best warrior. During this time, Guts learns of Griffith's mysterious pendant, the Behelit, along with Griffith's dream to rule a kingdom of his own. When the Hawks encounter Nosferatu Zodd, a monstrous immortal being, Guts and Griffith are spared only when Zodd sees the Behelit. Eventually, hired by the kingdom of Midland, helping to win the Hundred Year War against the Tudor empire, the Hawks are ordained as knights of Midland. Meanwhile, Guts gradually develops a romantic relationship with Griffith's unit commander, Casca, the Hawks' only female member. Having overheard Griffith say that he can only consider someone a true friend if they have their own dream, Guts leaves the Hawks after defeating Griffith in single combat. Devastated by this, Griffith ruins his fortunes by seducing the king's daughter, Charlotte. He is imprisoned and tortured, while the Hawks are hunted by the army of Midland. Guts spends the next year training to become a better swordsman, but is warned by a mysterious being he names "the Skull Knight" that his actions have instigated "the Eclipse". He temporarily returns to the Hawks, sparking a romantic relationship with the Hawks only female captain and his former rival, Casca, and helps the outlawed remnants of the group rescue Griffith, only to find him mutilated and unable to speak.

Griffith unknowingly activates his Behelit during a solar eclipse. The Hawks are transported to another dimension, where they encounter archdemons collectively known as the "God Hand" during a ceremony known as the Eclipse. Urged by the God Hand to join them and fulfill his ambitions, Griffith sacrifices his soldiers to the God Hand's "apostles"—humans like Zodd who have become powerful demons by sacrificing their loved ones and humanity for power. Each of the Hawks is branded with a symbol on their body identifying them as sacrifices. All of the group are slaughtered by the demons besides Guts and Casca and Griffith is reborn as the God Hand's fifth and final member, "Femto". Griffith's first act as a demon is to rape Casca in front of Guts, who loses his right eye and cuts off his own left forearm to escape, attempting to save Casca before losing consciousness. Both are saved from death and brought back into the physical world through the intervention of the Skull Knight. However, Casca is regresses into a childlike state from the experience. Guts learns that the "Brands of Sacrifice" that he and Casca received leave them open to be preyed upon by supernatural creatures every night. Casca is left in the care of the blacksmith Godo, his adoptive daughter Erica and Rickert, the youngest member of the Band of the Hawk who survived by not being present at the Eclipse. With a new sword named Dragonslayer and a prosthetic left arm containing a hidden cannon, Guts begins hunting down apostles in search of revenge on Griffith. During this time, Guts begins seeing his unborn child with Casca, deformed by Femto's rape and stillborn, appear before him.

Two years later, Guts is joined by an elf named Puck and a young thief named Isidro. Casca eventually runs away from the smithy, and Guts begins searching for her. Guts is later reunited with Casca as she is about to be burned as a witch in the city of St. Albion. There, along with Puck and Isidro, they encounter Farnese and Serpico of the Holy See Church's Holy Iron Chain Knights. Guts endures a nightmarish ordeal that ends in Griffith being incarnated into a new physical form through a misshapen apostle whose dream was to "hatch" a new world. This apostle also ingested the deformed infant, after stumbling upon its weakened and dying body moments before the Incarnation ceremony, resulting in Griffith's new body bearing some sort of influence of the infant. Puck suggests that Casca's mind might be restored if they take her to the Elven realm of Elfhelm. Guts heads there for sanctuary with the help of his new companions. They are soon joined by the witch Schierke, who teaches Farnese magic and negates the effects of the brand on Guts and Casca. From Schierke's master, the witch Flora, Guts also receives the Berserker Armour, a suit of armour that increases his strength, speed and endurance at the cost of his self-control. Meanwhile, Griffith creates a second Band of the Hawk, with Zodd and other demonic apostles among its ranks to battle the invading forces of the Kushan Empire, led by their rogue apostle emperor, Ganishka. The war between Griffith and Ganishka climaxes with the emperor's destruction and the overlapping of the mortal realm and the supernatural astral realm.

Now unopposed, Griffith finally obtains his own kingdom, establishing his rule over Midland with the endorsement of the Pope and Princess Charlotte, creating the city of Falconia to provide both the Midlanders and the rest of humanity with refuge from the ever-increasing attacks of mythical beasts, unaware that their new ruler is actually one of them. At the same time, Guts and his party take a ship toward Elfhelm. Following a dramatic battle with a supernatural island-sized monster known as the Sea God and recruiting one of the islanders, a merrow girl called Isma, Guts's party reaches Elfhelm, on the island of Skellig. The elf ruler, Danann, helps Farnese and Schierke travel into Casca's mind and restore her to her former self. However, despite recovering her memories, Casca still has not overcome the trauma from the events of the eclipse completely, usually collapsing when she sees Guts or remembers her fallen comrades. At the same time, Farnese and Schierke begin training with the other apprentice witches and wizards living on Skellig, during which Farnese expresses an interest in the power to heal human souls, specifically Casca. At the same time, Guts encounters the Skull Knight once again who tells him that his journey is at an end, guiding him to the creator of the Berserker Armour and teaching Guts about his own past with the God Hand. Meanwhile, Griffith is shown leading his new armies of both humans and "war demons" against an army of giants that have emerged due to the effects of Griffith's and Ganishka's war. After emerging victorious, Griffith participates in a council with the other nobles of Falconia before departing that evening for currently unknown reasons.

Production
While briefly working as an assistant to George Morikawa at 18, Miura had already planned some ideas for Berserk's development, having a dark warrior with a gigantic sword illustrated in his portfolio who would be the first conception of Guts.[5][6] Miura submitted manuscripts to a shōnen manga magazine for about four years before working for Hakusensha. However, he felt that he was not capable enough for it and they were also not interested in publishing science fiction or fantasy works.[7] In 1988, while working with Buronson on a manga titled King of Wolves,[8] Miura published a prototype of Berserk in Hakusensha's Gekkan ComiComi.[9][10] This 48-page prototype placed 2nd at the 7th ComiComi's Manga-School prize.[11] He later submitted his work to a magazine that, at the time, "was on the verge of going under", and he was switched around between several editors before meeting his first editor.[7] The serialization of Berserk began in Hakusensha's Monthly Animal House in 1989.[9][12] Miura commented that he landed the serial as soon as he made his debut, so he never had the opportunity to receive much criticism from editors.[7]

Miura stated that the inspiration for series' title was diffuse at the time of creation. He did not have information about the berserkers or the Berserker Armor (which first appeared in the 222nd chapter) planned out from the start. He chose the word, telling himself that "its mysterious aspect would stick well". Miura said that the title was connected to Guts’s imagery, influenced by Mad Max's eponymous character, further elaborating: "In short, starting from a world with a dark hero who is burning for revenge, prompts you to imagine a rabid character. When, guided by his anger, he will pour out this rage on overpowered enemies, we must insist on his fanaticism if you want to stay consistent. That’s why I thought "Berserk" would make a perfect title to represent my universe".[13] According to Miura, the series' dark fantasy setting was inspired by the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian and the Elric of Melniboné series.[14][15][16] Miura stated that he did not see dark fantasy as a genre in itself, but rather as an equivalent of general fantasy. He commented that outside of Japan the big works of fantasy, like The Lord of the Rings, contain dark elements, and in Japan, the fantasy genre was popularized by video games like Dragon Quest, which were aimed at children, and therefore, expurgated the dark elements, but since he received the influence from novels before that of those games, Miura "naturally turned to dark fantasy".[15][16]

Miura said that Fist of the North Star, by Buronson and Tetsuo Hara, was the work that had the greatest impact on his own work,[7] helping as well to develop his art style.[17][18] Miura also mentioned animator and manga artist Yoshikazu Yasuhiko and manga artist Fujihiko Hosono as early influences to his art style. Violence Jack by Go Nagai and Guin Saga by Kaoru Kurimoto inspired the series' story and atmosphere. Ranpo [ja] by Masatoshi Uchizaki served him as a reference for his backgrounds.[17][18] Miura said that his favorite manga series was Dororo by Osamu Tezuka, and that he wanted to create a fantasy work that possessed dark, "muddy" and yōkai-like elements.[19] Miura was also influenced by Star Wars,[20][21] adding that he learned the basics of storytelling from George Lucas and called the eponymous 1977 film his favorite work.[22] Miura commented about the influence of shōjo manga on the series, stating that it is about "expressing every feeling powerfully".[17][23] Particularly, he mentioned influence from Yumiko Ōshima,[17][23] and that the anime adaptations of The Rose of Versailles and Aim for the Ace!, both directed by Osamu Dezaki, inspired him to read The Rose of Versailles manga and the work of Keiko Takemiya.[16]

Some aspects of Guts (personality and design) were partially inspired by Miura's higschool friend and later fellow manga artist Kōji Mori [ja], by Mad Max and by Rutger Hauer performances in Flesh and Blood, Blade Runner, The Hitcher and The Blood of Heroes.[24][7][14][13] Gut's prosthetic hand was inspired by Dororo's Hyakkimaru and Cobra eponymous protagonist.[25] Kurt, the protagonist of Pygmalio [ja], by Shinji Wada, and an illustration of a giant wielding a sword, featured in The Snow Queen (Guin Saga spin-off), inspired the size of Guts' sword, the Dragon Slayer, by mixing both characters' swords.[17][18] Miura commented that when drawing the Dragon Slayer, he wanted to emulate the effect of Kenshiro's or Raoh's (Fist of the North Star) fist "flying out from the page", but he felt that Gut's sword did not have the same feeling of weight as a fist. He wanted to convey an “extension of reality” feel to the sword, similar to the depiction of the Fist of the North Star's Hokuto Shinken martial art, and make it believable for the readers.[26] Miura stated that “Black Swordsman” Guts was the first thing he was set on, but he did not have any idea about what his backstory would be. He focused on the character development up until around the third or fourth volume and then he would think about what brought him to revenge.[7]

Berserk is known for its frequent and often extended hiatuses,[27] which date back to late 2006.[28] Following a main storyline chapter released in February 2012, three consecutive chapters about Guts's childhood were published from June to July of the same year.[29][30][31] The main storyline resumed after eight months in October 2012,[32][33] and the series went on hiatus after a chapter published in December of the same year.[34] Miura took a break to work on his 6-chapter mini-series Giganto Maxia,[35] and Berserk was published intermittently from April to September 2014.[36][37][38][39] After a 10-month hiatus, the manga came back in July 2015,[40] and was published monthly until November of the same year,[41] before entering on hiatus.[42] It was published monthly from June to September 2016, before entering another hiatus.[43][44] The manga resumed publication from March to June 2017,[45][46] and was then published on a monthly basis from December 2017 to May 2018.[47][48] Four months after, another chapter was published in August 2018, before entering an 8-month hiatus.[49][50] Two chapters were published in April[51][52] and August 2019.[53][54] Three chapters were published in April,[55] July[56] and October 2020, respectively.[57] A chapter was published in January 2021.[58] On May 20, 2021, Hakusensha announced that Miura died at 54 due to an acute aortic dissection on May 6, leaving it unclear if the manga will continue or not.[59][60][61]

Themes
Berserk explores a wide range of themes and topics. Free will and destiny are discussed within the series.[62][63][64] Human resilience is a recurring theme, with many characters coming from horrible backgrounds, constantly struggling against an unjust world.[64][65] Guts struggles with destiny itself and is constantly resisting the pull of predetermination.[62] Griffith also embodies this idea of resilience, by chasing his dream of ruling his own kingdom, despite his lowborn origins, as well as free will, by his own decision to sacrifice the Band of the Hawk in order to achieve his dream.[64]

The series also explores human nature and morality, as characters struggle between becoming good human beings or falling into madness and evil.[66][65] Guts, at the beginning of the story, is presented as an antihero who does not care about killing and is indifferent to people who aid him. Guts does not act in accordance with definitions of right and wrong, he operates within a gray area, and does not attempt to be heroic or protect the innocent.[67][68] However, as the story progresses, it is shown that he is in fact a person who is deeply conflicted internally.[69][70] His tragic and traumatic past, unfolded in the Golden Age arc, proves that Guts is a much more complex character.[71][67][65] Anne Lauenroth of Anime News Network, wrote that Griffith is "not evil at all", but "arrogant and brutally realistic about human nature". The suppression of his own human nature would initiate his demise as the Hawk and the rise of Femto.[64]

Friendship, comradery and human relations are other explored themes.[62][16] As a child, Guts tried to build some level of friendship with his mercenary group,[72] but due to his traumatic experience with them, he lost trust in people.[73][74][75] However, through the time he was with Griffith and the rest of the Band of the Hawk, Guts formed bonds, friendships, animosities and co-dependencies, maturing as well as individual.[65][64][76][63] Miura stated that he based the Band of the Hawk on his own high school friend relationship experience.[16][77] Specifically, he mentioned that his friendship with later fellow manga artist Kōji Mori partially inspired the Guts and Griffith's relationship.[7] Jacob Chapman of Anime News Network, wrote that through their friendship, Guts' ambitions were elevated and Griffith's were lowered, allowing both of them to consider a new future for the first time, one where they fight side-by-side as equals and die on the battlefield, but they reject this future out of their own personal fears, as Guts did not think he was "good enough" for a happy future and Griffith was terrified of his lofty dream crumbling into something more mundane.[78] Miura also said that the story of fight between Guts and Griffith speaks about their change after having built their personalities.[16]

The Golden Age arc has been compared to a Greek tragedy.[79][80] According to Lauenroth, Griffith's hamartia lies in how he compartmentalizes his feelings of guilt and shame that would get in the way of his dream and how he deals to repress them. His inner dialogue in his second duel with Guts; "If I can't have him, I don't care", marks the Golden Age arc peripeteia.[64] When Guts comes running to rescue him during the Eclipse, Griffith reaches his moment of anagnorisis, with his thought: "You're the only one…who made me forget my dream".[64]

Betrayal and revenge are major themes in the series. Guts suffered his first betrayal when Gambino sold Guts' body to another soldier for a few coins. He would eventually take revenge against the soldier, killing him on the battlefield and he later would kill Gambino as well.[65][73] Guts is in a quest for revenge after his comrades were betrayed by Griffith and sacrificed by the God Hand.[65] This desire for vengeance has been his main reason of survival.[81][68]

Religion has been also touched in the series, mainly through the characters of Mozgus and Farnese. Miura stated that he created Mozgus based on the concept of rigid personality to create a religious fanatic character with no flexibility.[77] Farnese is presented as the figurehead of the Holy Iron Chain Knights, inquisitors tasked with burning heretics and witches at the stake.[82] After her encounter with Guts, she finds it increasingly difficult to resolve her faith with the atrocities she became party to, as Guts, inversely, takes action against something he disagrees with. Guts denounces the very idea of prayer, claiming that the act of clasping hands only prevents people from realizing what they desire through their own means. Farnese eventually begins to reject her faith and the rigidity of her beliefs. After the battle between Guts and Mozgus, Farnese decides to follow Guts, to find a new purpose in her life, away from her social position and the church.[83]

Critical reception
Berserk has been widely acclaimed by critics. Reviewing the first volume, Michael Aronson of Manga Life described Berserk as "a curious mix of medieval barbarism, sorcery and futurist technology, combining ghouls, guns and gore. The result is beautifully rendered badass action with enough bloody violence to keep fans of the genre happy".[187] Publishers Weekly wrote: "Berserk offers a montage of merciless violence and thrilling action sequences in a blend of pure fantasy and graphic horror".[188] Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock wrote: "Berserk redefines what is considered a well-written fantasy manga. There are few manga that come anywhere close to creating a complex tale that includes medieval warfare, magic, and horror".[68] Reviewing the first two volumes, Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics wrote: "it's still hard to identify what about Berserk brings across such a fascination. Is it the characters? The visual look of the monsters? The little hints of a troubled past, like Guts's tattoo that oozes blood? All of the above? I'm not sure, but I do know that I'm hooked".[189] In his review of the third volume, Daniel Briscoe of The Fandom Post called the series "a tragic story of hatred, violence, and innocence lost", adding that Miura "manages to pack so much emotion, both good and bad, next to so much violence and gore I believe is a testament to his writing and his artwork".[72] In his review of the first six volumes, Satyajit Chetri of Rolling Stone wrote: "By the end of the fifth volume, Berserk has morphed into a touching tale of humanity, friendship and ambition. It is less about the blood spilt and more about the choices made by the characters, the small twists that will ultimately turn friends into nemeses".[190] Reviewing the twelfth volume, Eduardo M. Chavez writing for AnimeOnDVD, commented that despite its long-running publication, "Berserk is as shocking and unique as ever this far into the series. There are few titles out there that can sustain the level of intensity and relevance as this".[80] In his review of the twenty-first volume, Scott Cambpell of Active Anime wrote: "The deep, dark places that this manga travels to both in story and in artistic expression can be as interesting and captivating as they are horrifying", adding that the are not many other stories or manga quite like Berserk.[191]

Writing for SciFi.com, Zac Bertschy said: "Kentaro Miura has managed to create a story that's not only darkly disturbing, but also absorbing and affecting on a deeper level than most manga titles can achieve". Bertschy praised the story and character development, concluding: "Not for the faint of heart, Berserk is perfect for mature manga fans who like a little blood with their drama".[192] In Manga: The Complete Guide, author Jason Thompson gave Berserk 4 out of four stars. He called it "A blood-soaked sword-and-sorcery epic with elements of Clive Barker's Hellraiser", and wrote: "Berserk's medieval European world of mud and blood is so realistic—and drawn in such realistic detail—that when dark fantasy elements begin to intrude upon it, they do so with a slow, dawning horror".[4] Thompson, in a review for j-pop.com, also wrote: "Despite the slaughter, Berserk doesn't feel as amoral as it could be; our hero is a killer, but given his well-developed back story, his occasional tears of remorse seem more genuine than, say, Crying Freeman's".[193] In another article, writing for Anime News Network (ANN), Thompson said that Berserk started as "the story of a lone swordsman traveling the world fighting demons with blood and sweat", and it was later turned into a "fantasy RPG party of heroes with a magic-user, a thief, a fighter, some elves, etc.", commenting that Miura apparently was "aiming the series at a younger age group". Despite this, Thompson stated: "I'm still impressed by Miura's great art and his ability to create such a long storyline with so much scope and (relative to other manga, at least) so little filler. No other seinen fantasy manga has such well-developed characters with such deep backstories, even for the minor characters".[65] Matt Fagaly, writing for Crunchyroll, analyzed Berserk's use of shōnen and shōjo manga tropes in the Lost Children arc (volumes 14–16), which resulted in an "entirely original and moving narrative". Fagaly commented about the arc protagonist, Jill, and her hopeful words at the end of that story, further adding: "I have never seen another Shonen or Shojo express this notion with the same audacity, depth, and idiosyncrasy as Berserk".[194] Carl Kimlinger, writing for ANN, in his review of the thirty-fifth volume, compared Guts' "monster-plagued" trip to Elfhelm to the fantasy tales of Robert E. Howard and, in comparing the volume to the previous ones, he wrote that series dropped down a notch, although he stated that it was not a "disastrous drop", but "just the series falling back into a comfortable, classical adventure mode".[195] Brittany Vincent of Otaku USA said: "Berserk is undoubtedly one of the most unique and engaging Western-style fantasies of all time".[75] Writing for Syfy Wire, Eric Frederiksen said: "Berserk is one of the longest-running manga, and consistently one of the darkest out there, but also one of the most emotionally powerful and rewarding".[62] Writing for Crunchyroll, Peter Fobian expressed: "Berserk is one of the most deeply personal works I’ve ever read, both for myself and in my perception of Miura's works. The series' transformation in the past 30 years artistically and thematically is so singular it's difficult to find another work that comes close".[196]

Miura's artwork has been particularly praised by critics. Bertschy said that the artwork is where Berserk "really shines", adding: "The cross-hatching work, the level of detail, it's all stunning. Every page is a work of art, each scene drawn with the utmost attention to detail and atmosphere". He compared the art to the 1950s horror comics from EC Comics and found it fitting to the series' "gruesome nature". Bertschy concluded: "Miura is a fabulously talented artist and author, and future manga series by him will be met with great anticipation".[192] Thompson said: "Miura's art is one of the real attractions. The people may occasionally look funky, but castles, knights, horses, and Baroque and Romanesque trappings are drawn with detail and accuracy".[193] McElhatton wrote that he was "pretty unimpressed" with Miura's art at first, but he changed his mind after the demons appeared, stating: "Miura draws demons in such a wrong and disturbing manner that it's unsettling. That's how demons should look, of course".[189] Publishers Weekly wrote: "this work has a style characteristic of other 1980s manga, with sparse dialogue, spectacular action sequences and gritty character art. The pencil shading and use of shadows lend an ominous tone".[188] Campbell wrote: "You just can't know what 'attention to detail' means until you read Berserk – it's rare when it comes to what it has to offer to all the readers out there, so really it's no wonder that it stands out as much as it does".[197] Campbell also commented: "The closest thing visually that Berserk could be compared to might be Claymore, another very good manga – but really Berserk is on a plain of its own".[191] Writing for Advanced Media Network, Serdar Yegulalp said that the artwork of the first volumes are "a little rougher and less polished than the later ones", but that after the eight volume "there is scarcely a page that doesn't look spectacular", adding that "Miura's loving attention to detail on most any page or panel is stupefying".[198] Writing for ANN, Casey Brienza wrote: "Miura's artwork is exquisite and, remarkably, drawn without the help of an army of assistants. And while he has been great right from the first page of volume one, he has improved over the many years of working on Berserk".[199] In another review for Graphic Novel Reporter, Brieza wrote: "Unlike virtually all other commercially successful manga artists, Miura produces his artwork without assistants,[b] and the exquisite detail of this erotic-grotesque, Dungeons & Dragons-esque high fantasy issues from his hand and his hand alone", adding that it is "one that appeals to men and women alike".[202] Carlo Santos, reviewer from ANN; wrote: "Miura's complete command of light and shadow gives every moment an otherworldly quality—this is one of the few series that can honestly claim to transport its readers to another time and place—and the attention to backgrounds is a welcome sight when so many other artists are too lazy to be bothered".[203] Kimlinger wrote that Miura's art "is among the most intricate, evocative and plain beautiful art ever to be put to page and arranged cinematically. He draws wonderfully expressive faces, awe-inspiring monsters, gorgeous armor and some of the finest gore to be found just about anywhere".[204] Chetri described Miura's otherworld featured in the first arc as "something a drug-addled MC Escher would have painted", also noting homages to Hellraiser and H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and called Miura a "splendid storyteller whose artwork is stark and bold enough to bring the world of Guts to life magnificently".[190] Writing for IGN, Bruna Penilhas commented that Miura's level of detail in his illustrations is "impressive from start to finish", praising the design and features of his characters, adding that he was able to "perfectly illustrate characteristics and feelings such as pain, anger and sadness".[205] Alex Traub from The New York Times commented about the comparison of Miura's drawings to Hieronymus Bosch's paintings, particularly for Miura's images of "little human figures occupying sweeping fantastical landscapes", adding: "Mr. Miura was known for his spectacular, apocalyptic style; specific images — a humongous sword, a monster cloaked in shadow — are immediately recognizable to his fans".[206]

Legacy
Berserk is regarded as one of the most influential dark fantasy works.[207][208][209][210] Peter Fobian, in an essay of the legacy and impact of Berserk, called it a "monolith not only for anime and manga, but also fantasy literature, video games, you name it", comparing its level of influence to Blade Runner, further adding: "it’s difficult to imagine what the world might look like without it, and the generations of creators the series inspired".[196]

According to writer and editor Kazushi Shimada, series like Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba or Jujutsu Kaisen would not have existed if not for Berserk.[211] Some dark fantasy manga authors who have declared influence from Berserk include Hajime Isayama (Attack on Titan),[212] Kazue Kato (Blue Exorcist)[213] and Yana Toboso (Black Butler).[214] Other authors influenced by Berserk include Makoto Yukimura (Vinland Saga),[215] Yūki Tabata (Black Clover)[216] and Ryōgo Narita (Baccano! and Durarara!!).[217] Adi Shankar, the 2017 Castlevania showrunner, said in an interview that he would like to adapt Berserk, calling the "hyper-detailed beauty" of Miura’s artwork a "true masterpiece",[218] while Adam Deats, Castlevania assistant director, stated that the show was inspired by Berserk.[206]

Ramsey Isler of IGN stated that Guts "served as a template for many heroes that came after him", adding that the "ridiculously big sword he wields" started a trend, spread to characters like Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII and Ichigo Kurosaki from Bleach.[219]

Berserk has also inspired a number of video games, including the Dynasty Warriors series,[220][221] the Final Fantasy series (considerably Final Fantasy VII and XIV),[220][222] the Souls series,[221] Bloodborne,[209] and Capcom's Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma series.[223][122][224]

Finnish heavy metal music band Battle Beast have written songs about Berserk, including several on their 2013 self-titled album.[225][226] When guitarist Anton Kabanen left Battle Beast in 2015, he formed Beast in Black and continues to write songs about the series.[227] The deathcore band Brand of Sacrifice released the album God Hand in 2019. Both the band and album are hugely inspired by Berserk.[228] In 2021, deathcore band Slaughter to Prevail released a music video for their song "Zavali Ebalo", which featured scenes from the Berserk 1997 anime series.
