JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (Japanese: ジョジョの奇妙な冒険, Hepburn: JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. It was originally serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1987 to 2004, and was transferred to the monthly seinen manga magazine Ultra Jump in 2005. The series is divided into eight story arcs, each following a new protagonist bearing the "JoJo" nickname; the eighth part, JoJolion, began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is Shueisha's largest ongoing manga series by volume count, with its chapters collected in 130 tankōbon volumes as of May 2021.

A 13-episode original video animation series adapting the manga's third part, Stardust Crusaders, was produced by A.P.P.P. and released from 1993 to 2002. The studio later produced an anime film adapting the first part, Phantom Blood, which was released in theaters in Japan in 2007. In October 2012, an anime television series produced by David Production adapting Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency began broadcast on Tokyo MX. As of July 2019, the studio has produced four seasons adapting through the manga's fifth part, Golden Wind. A live-action film based on the fourth part, Diamond Is Unbreakable, was released in Japan in 2017.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is well-known for its art style and poses; frequent references to Western popular music and fashion; and battles centered around Stands, psycho-spiritual manifestations with unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history, and it has spawned a media franchise including one-shot manga, light novels, and video games. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by Viz Media, which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.


Plot the universe of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a reflection of the real world with the added existence of supernatural forces and beings. In this setting, some people are capable of transforming their inner spiritual power into a Stand (スタンド, Sutando); another significant form of energy is Hamon (波紋, "Ripple"), a martial arts technique that allows its user to focus bodily energy into sunlight via controlled breathing. The narrative of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is split into parts with independent stories and different characters. Each of the series' protagonists is a member of the Joestar family, whose mainline descendants possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular "JoJo".[a] The first six parts take place within a single continuity whose generational conflict stems from the rivalry between Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando, while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 1 Phantom Blood, in late 19th-century England, the young son of a wealthy landowner, Jonathan Joestar, meets his new adopted brother Dio Brando, who loathes him and plans to usurp him as heir to the Joestar family. When Dio's attempts are thwarted, he transforms himself into a vampire with the use of an ancient Stone Mask and destroys the Joestar estate. Jonathan embarks on a journey, meets new allies and masters the Hamon (波紋, "Ripple") martial arts technique to stop Dio, who has made world domination his new goal.
Part 2: Battle Tendency (戦闘潮流, Sentō Chōryū)
Volumes 5–12, 69 chapters. In 1938, a German expedition discovers and awakens a Pillar Man, a powerful humanoid whose race created the Stone Mask. The Pillar Man kills the researchers and escapes to awaken the other Pillar Men so that they may regain dominance over humanity by obtaining the Red Stone of Aja. Joseph Joestar, Jonathan's grandson, unites with new allies and masters Hamon to defeat the Pillar Men.
Part 3: Stardust Crusaders (スターダストクルセイダース, Sutādasuto Kuruseidāsu)
Volumes 13–28, 152 chapters. In 1989, Dio Brando (now referred to as "DIO") awakens after his tomb is salvaged from the ocean. Because DIO had managed to capture Jonathan's body, Stands (スタンド, Sutando) awaken in Jonathan's descendants, consisting of Joseph, his daughter Holly Kujo and grandson Jotaro Kujo. Holly, however, is unable to cope with her own Stand, and has only 50 days to live. Jotaro, Joseph and their new allies set out to defeat DIO before this deadline expires, and encounter DIO's henchmen along the way.
Part 4: Diamond Is Unbreakable (ダイヤモンドは砕けない, Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai)
Volumes 29–47, 174 chapters. In 1999, the Joestar family learns that Joseph has an illegitimate son, Josuke Higashikata,[b] who lives in the fictional Japanese town of Morioh. Josuke learns of a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands upon those struck by its arrowheads. As they hunt down the Bow and Arrow, Josuke and his allies encounter a serious threat in the form of the Stand-using serial killer Yoshikage Kira.
Part 5: Golden Wind (黄金の風, Ōgon no Kaze)
Volumes 47–63, 155 chapters. In 2001 Naples, Italy, Giorno Giovanna is the son of DIO, conceived while DIO was in possession of Jonathan Joestar's body. Giorno seeks to become a mafia boss in order to eliminate drug dealers who sell their wares to children. His team, which consists of Stand users, must confront the mafia boss Diavolo and protect his daughter Trish Una, whom Diavolo intends to kill in order to hide his identity.
Part 6: Stone Ocean (ストーンオーシャン, Sutōn Ōshan)
Volumes 64–80, 158 chapters. In 2011 near Port St. Lucie, Florida, Jotaro Kujo's daughter Jolyne Cujoh is framed for murder and sent to prison. She works together with other Stand-using prisoners and her father to hunt down prison chaplain Father Enrico Pucci, loyalist to DIO, who seeks the creation of a new universe shaped to his and DIO's will.
Part 7: Steel Ball Run (スティール・ボール・ラン, Sutīru Bōru Ran)
Volumes 81–104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline's 1890, United States President Funny Valentine holds a cross-country horse race with a $50 million reward to the winner. Valentine intends to use the race to gather the scattered parts of a holy corpse for his own nationalistic ends. Racers Gyro Zeppeli and Johnny Joestar uncover Valentine's ploy and must defend themselves from his hired assassins.
Part 8: JoJolion (ジョジョリオン, Jojorion)
Volumes 105–130, 108 chapters. Described by Araki himself as "[a] story about breaking a curse", it is set in the same universe as Steel Ball Run in 2012, the town of Morioh has been devastated by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the "Wall Eyes" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose discovers a young man suffering from amnesia buried in the rubble and nicknames him "Josuke". Josuke tries to uncover the secret of his past and discovers that he is the result of a fusion of two people. Josuke is also confronted with the activities of a local crime syndicate, which sells the fruit of a mysterious Locacaca tree, capable of healing people and then "taking" something in return.
Production

Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by Paul Gauguin which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.[3][4]
For JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base before introducing modern elements. As an example, he often draws in a realistic style but uses surreal colors. Araki has been aiming to draw real spirits in JoJo resulting in him going to the Kappa River in Tōno, Iwate, to get a better understanding of the concept.[5] Araki claims to be inspired from the art of the 1980s, shading techniques in Western art, and classical paintings; the manga coloring is based on calculations rather than consistency, with Araki citing artists like Paul Gauguin as inspiration.[3] He also claims mystery is the central theme of the manga, as he was fascinated by it as a child. Furthermore, Araki wanted to explore superpowers and energy in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure resulting in various concepts such as Hamon and Stands.[3] He said that the supernatural basis of the fights in his series evened the battlefield for women and children to match up against strong men.[6] For Stardust Crusaders in particular, Araki was influenced by role-playing games in designing the characters' skills.[3]

The characters had no models, except Jotaro Kujo, who was based on Clint Eastwood. Araki stated that he wanted to try a different type of main character for every part; for example, Part 1's Jonathan Joestar was a serious and honest person, whereas Part 2's Joseph Joestar was a trickster.[7] Although their personalities are different, the two share a physical resemblance in order to have some continuity because it was unheard of in the 1980s for a main character to die in a Weekly Shōnen Jump series.[8] Araki's consistent focus on the Joestar family was intended to give a feeling of pride as well as the wonder and mystery surrounding the lineage.[7]

Araki originally planned the series as a trilogy, with the final confrontation taking place in present-day Japan. However, Araki did not want Part 3 to be a tournament affair, which was popular in Weekly Shōnen Jump at the time, and therefore decided to make it a "road movie" inspired by Around the World in Eighty Days.[9] With Part 4, Araki said that he moved away from "muscle men" as they fell out of popularity with readers and he wanted to focus more on fashion. When designing his characters' outfits, Araki considers both everyday fashion and "cartoonish, bizarre clothing that would be impractical in real life".[10] For Part 6, Araki wrote a female protagonist for the first time which he found complicated, but also interesting due to the humanity she could possess.[11] He later described Part 2's much earlier supporting character Lisa Lisa as fresh and "unheard of" in both manga and society in general for its time, and said it was exciting to challenge people's expectations with the female warrior-type.[6] Having not specifically set out on creating a disabled character, Araki explained that Part 7's paraplegic Johnny Joestar was a natural result of wanting to show a character who could grow, both physically and mentally, during a race where "he would be forced not only to rely on other people, but horses as well."[10]

Araki uses unique onomatopoeia and poses in the series, which he attributes to his love for heavy metal and horror films.[12] The poses, which are known in Japan as JoJo-dachi (ジョジョ立ち, lit. "JoJo standing"), are iconic on his book covers and panels, and were inspired by Araki's trip to Italy in his 20s and his studies of Michelangelo's sculptures.[13]

Hirohiko Araki, the author of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure began serialization in Weekly Shōnen Jump's combined issue #1–2 of 1987, published in Japan by Shueisha on January 1, 1987.[14] The series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the "JoJo" nickname. The first part, titled Phantom Blood, was serialized until October 1987 and collected in five tankōbon volumes; the second, Battle Tendency, was serialized from November 1987 to March 1989 and collected in seven volumes. Stardust Crusaders, the third part, was serialized from March 1989 to April 1992 and collected in 16 volumes, completing Araki's originally planned trilogy.[2]

After volume 63 (the last volume of Golden Wind), the tankōbon numbering for each subsequent part restarted from one. Stone Ocean, the sixth part, was serialized from January 2000 to April 2003 and collected in 17 volumes. The first 23 chapters of the seventh part, Steel Ball Run, were serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from January to October 2004; in March 2005, the series was transferred to the monthly seinen manga magazine Ultra Jump. It ran until April 2011, and was collected in 24 volumes. JoJolion, the eighth part, began its serialization in May 2011; it has been collected in 25 volumes as of February 2021.

Between 2002 and 2009, the first six parts in the series were re-released by Shueisha in bunkoban format;[15] Steel Ball Run was re-released in the format in 2017 and 2018.[16] A sōshūhen omnibus series recreating the first four parts as they originally appeared in Weekly Shōnen Jump (including color pages, promotional text, and next chapter previews) was published between 2012 and 2016.[17] Since 2012, all eight parts in the series have been digitally colored and distributed by Shueisha for smartphones and tablet computers under the brand name "JOJO-D".[18] A premium hardcover release of the first three parts was published under the brand "JoJonium" between 2013 and 2015.[19]

In the early 1990s, Viz Media reportedly had plans for an English-language release of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure in North America as The Strange Adventures of Jojo;[2] in 2002, the series was unsuccessfully considered for release as monthly comic books.[2] Between November 2005 and December 2010, Viz published Stardust Crusaders, the most well-known part in the series, in 16 volumes.[20][21] However, the company changed the names of several characters and Stands due to copyright concerns and censored certain scenes, including scenes of animal violence redrawn by Araki himself.[2] In 2013, Viz expressed further interest in localizing the series, but explained its difficulties in doing so due to Araki's numerous references to real musicians and fashion designers.[22] Viz began publishing the JoJonium release of Phantom Blood digitally in September 2014, with a three-volume hardcover print edition following throughout 2015.[23] Battle Tendency was published in four volumes in 2015 and 2016,[24] and Stardust Crusaders was published in ten volumes from 2016 to 2019.[25] Viz began publishing a new digital and hardcover edition of Diamond Is Unbreakable in May 2019, and has released eight volumes as of February 2021.[26]

Reception
Manga
Sales
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has over 100 million copies in print,[64] and is one of the best-selling Weekly Shōnen Jump series of all-time.[65] The first volume of JoJolion was the second best-selling manga for its debut week, its second volume was number three and its third was number two.[66][67][68] All three volumes were some of the best-selling manga of 2012.[69][70] All three volumes of Viz Media's release of Phantom Blood and all four volumes of Battle Tendency reached the top seven positions on The New York Times Manga Best Seller list.[71]

Critical reception
Reviewing the first volume, IGN named JoJo's Bizarre Adventure a "must read," declaring the artwork of "a standard virtually unseen in most manga produced today."[72] Otaku USA's Joseph Luster called the series "fun as hell" and noted how the beginning is not filled with action like most Weekly Shōnen Jump series, but instead has the tension of horror and thriller films.[73] Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network wrote that the first volume "combines a fighting story with a solid emotional background, and will absolutely put hair on your chest." She called Dio an excellent villain that the readers can enjoy hating. However, she criticized the anatomy of characters, saying "bodies are often twisted into impossible positions."[74] Comics & Gaming Magazine's Cole Watson also strongly praised Dio as the highlight character of Part 1, stating that his eyes were glued to the page whenever he appeared, and described him as "the literal embodiment of Satan in manga form." Watson gave Phantom Blood a 7.5 out of 10, writing that while there is a lot to enjoy, it primarily serves as Dio's origin story and there are some moments that are "agonizingly slow."[75]

Silverman described Part 2 as "less urgent" than Part 1, which allows for more humor and insanity, while still letting the reader get attached to the characters.[76] She felt positively about how strikingly different the protagonist Joseph is from Part 1's Jonathan.[77] However, she wrote that Araki's art had gotten even more "physically improbable," making it difficult to distinguish body parts.[77] When discussing his views on having characters die in a series, writer Gen Urobuchi cited Battle Tendency's Caesar Zeppeli as a character who became "immortal" thanks to his death.[78]

Reviewing Stardust Crusaders, Silverman enjoyed seeing Part 2's Joseph team up with new protagonist Jotaro and was impressed that Araki was able to keep Dio out of Part 2 completely, only to bring him back for Part 3.[79] She initially called the replacement of Hamon with Stands both understandable and a bit of a disappointment, since the "insane physical abilities and contortions" caused by the former were a large source of the fun in the first two parts.[79] Silverman later described Stand battles as exciting and creative in subsequent reviews.[80][81]

Anime News Network had both Silverman and Faye Hopper review the first volume of Part 4. Silverman called the beginning slower and not as instantly engrossing as the previous parts, but felt this allowed Josuke, whom she and Hopper both described as kinder than the previous protagonists, to develop as a character. Hopper stated that Diamond Is Unbreakable is sometimes criticized for a "lack of a strong narrative throughline" in comparison to other parts, but argued that this is one of its greatest strengths as it allows the main characters to "simply be, lending them an amiable humanity that none of the over-the-top archetypes in the first 3 Parts ever had."[82]

Heidi Kemps, also of Otaku USA, was mostly positive in her review of Rohan at the Louvre, praising the art for being drawn in full-color by hand, although noted that readers new to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure might not fully understand the ending due to there being only a brief explanation of Rohan's Stand power.[83]

Accolades
For the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006, Japanese fans voted JoJo's Bizarre Adventure second on a list of the Top 10 Manga of all time.[84] The series ranked 10th in a 2009 survey by Oricon on what manga series people want to see receive a live-action adaptation.[85] The 2013 edition of Kono Manga ga Sugoi!, which surveys people in the manga and publishing industry, named JoJolion the 12th best manga series for male readers.[86] JoJolion won the grand prize for manga at the 2013 Japan Media Arts Festival.[87] In November 2014, readers of Media Factory's Da Vinci magazine voted JoJo's Bizarre Adventure number 5 on a list of Weekly Shōnen Jump's greatest manga series of all time.[88] On TV Asahi's Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150.000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure ranked 10th.[89][90]

Anime
The first set of OVAs was given three out of five stars by Eric Gaede of THEM Anime Reviews. He praised the fight scenes as more believable than those from other series such as Dragon Ball and the characters' personalities, although felt the villains resorted to clichés when they are about to be defeated. However, he called the story "disjointed" and the animation "drab and colorless".[91]

The JoJo's Bizarre Adventure anime television series was named one of the best of 2012 by Otaku USA.[92] It was added to the list by Joseph Luster, however, in his review he cited David Production having a small budget for several of his problems with the series, stating some portions of the animation are a "butt hair above motion comic standards," but that it usually makes up for it in "sheer style."[93] Michael Toole of Anime News Network had similar views, writing that the show's good writing, art direction, and pacing were "sometimes obscured by grade-Z animation."[34]

At the 2013 CEDEC Awards, the anime's opening sequence won in the Visual Arts division.[94] Several critics have credited the success of the anime adaptation for bringing about a surge of popularity for the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure franchise amongst Western audiences.[34][95] In 2018, Danni Wilmoth of Crunchyroll included the series on her list of "The 20 Series Every Anime Fan Needs to Watch".[96] In 2019, Polygon named the series as one of the best anime of the 2010s.[97]

Gadget Tsūshin listed "Pesci, Pesci, Pesci, Pesci yo!", a quote from the fifteenth episode of Golden Wind, in their 2019 anime buzzwords list.[98]

Controversy
In May 2008, both Shueisha and studio A.P.P.P. halted manga/OVA shipments of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure after a complaint had been launched against them from anonymous online Egyptian Islamic fundamentalists, after noticing a scene in the OVAs that has the villain, Dio Brando, reading a book depicting pages from the Qur'an.[2][99] This recall affected the English-language releases as well, causing Viz Media and Shueisha to cease publication for a year. Even though the manga did not feature that specific scene, Shueisha had Araki redraw scenes that depicted characters fighting on top of, and destroying, mosques for later printings of the series.[2] Viz resumed publication a year later, with the eleventh volume being published on April 7, 2009. Jason Thompson later included Shueisha's changes to the manga on a list of "The Greatest Censorship Fails" in manga.[100]

Legacy and collaborations
The September 2007 issue of Cell had a cover drawn by Hirohiko Araki with a ligase represented as a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stand.[101] He also contributed artwork towards the restoration of Chūson-ji following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[102] Araki contributed JoJo-inspired art for Sayuri Ishikawa's 2012 album X -Cross-, where she performs one of the series' iconic poses and is drawn wearing jewelry from the manga.[103] JoJo-style artwork has also been produced for other literature, such as for a 2008 collection featuring Yasunari Kawabata's short story "The Dancing Girl of Izu"[104] and a 2012 reprint of Tamaki Saitō's Lacan for Surviving.[105]

In 2009, Araki's was one of five artists featured in the Louvre's Le Louvre invite la bande dessinée ("The Louvre Invites Comic-Strip Art") exhibition for his artwork of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. To commemorate this honor, he wrote Rohan at the Louvre (岸辺露伴 ルーヴルへ行く, Kishibe Rohan Rūvuru e Iku), a 123-page full color story starring Rohan Kishibe visiting the Louvre and discovering a cursed painting tied to his family.[106][107][108] The following year it was published in France and ran in Ultra Jump, and in February 2012 was translated and released in North America by NBM Publishing.[109]

From July 19 to August 18, 2019, the Tower Records store in Shibuya held an exhibit celebrating the finale of the fifth part of the series, Golden Wind, and to promote the release of two games, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Pitter Patter Pop! and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Last Survivor.[110][111] The exhibit showed various concept art pieces from the series' artists as well as scripts from the show. Visitors could receive free items such as stickers, folders, and cards upon completion of various tasks, such as answering a quiz or buying a certain amount of items.[112] Each floor of the Tower Records building had a character on display, as a cardboard cutout and on the elevator doors. On August 14, 2019, a panel was held with directors Hideya Takahashi and Yasuhiro Kimura, and producer Kasama.[113]

Several video game characters, such as Street Fighter's Guile and Tekken's Paul Phoenix, were inspired by JoJo's Polnareff.[114] When they discovered a new species of Neostygarctus in 2013, scientists Shinta Fujimoto and Katsumi Miyazaki named it Neostygarctus lovedeluxe after a Stand from Diamond Is Unbreakable.[115] The song "Don't Bite the Dust" by heavy metal band Lovebites was influenced by and named after a Stand from Diamond Is Unbreakable.[116]

From September 17 to October 6, 2011, the Gucci store in Shinjuku hosted the Gucci x Hirohiko Araki x Spur "Rohan Kishibe Goes to Gucci" Exhibition, a collaboration between the luxury Italian clothing brand, Araki, and the Japanese fashion magazine Spur.[117] The exhibit celebrated the 90th anniversary of Gucci and featured a life-size figure of Rohan Kishibe, as well as numerous illustrations by Araki that included actual pieces of the brand's own 2011–2012 fall/winter collection and his own original fashion designs.[117] The October 2011 issue of Spur featured another one-shot manga titled Rohan Kishibe Goes to Gucci (岸辺露伴 グッチへ行く, Kishibe Rohan Guchi e Yuku), in which Rohan goes to a Gucci factory to discover the secret behind a magical handbag with the characters wearing and using Gucci products.[118][119] This was followed by another collaboration in the February 2013 issue of Spur with Jolyne, Fly High with Gucci (徐倫、GUCCIで飛ぶ, Jorīn, Gutchi de Tobu), starring Jolyne Cujoh from Part 6.[120][121] A free English translation of the latter was previously available on Gucci's Facebook page. Again, Araki's artwork was featured in Gucci's storefront displays around the world.[122][123]

25th anniversary
There were several art exhibitions in 2012 in Japan for the manga's 25th anniversary. The first was in Sendai, Araki's birthplace, where a Lawson store was remodeled to look like the "Owson" store that appears in Diamond Is Unbreakable and JoJolion.[124][125][126][127] The store was opened from July 28 to September 30, and contained exclusive goods with the Owson name. The second exhibition was held in Tokyo from October 6 to November 4 and hangouts were held on Google Plus to allow fans to view the gallery at night through the lens of Remote Romance (リモートロマンス, Rimōto Romansu), an original "Stand" Araki and his team created for the event.[128][129] The exhibit was taken to Italy from June 28 to July 14, 2013, and shown at the Gucci showroom in Florence.[128][130]

The October 2012 issue of Ultra Jump contained a special booklet titled 25 Years With JoJo that also celebrated the anniversary; it featured messages and tribute art from well-known manga artists such as Akira Toriyama, Yoshihiro Togashi, Eiichiro Oda, Clamp, and 18 others.[131][132] During the 25th anniversary celebrations, a special smartphone with a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure-inspired UI was released.[133]

To celebrate the release of the All Star Battle video game created for the 25th anniversary, a special JoJo-themed train traveled the Yamanote Line in Tokyo from August 29 to September 9, 2013. Illustrations and advertisements of the series littered the interior, with videos of the game shown on displays, while the exterior had 33 characters as livery.
